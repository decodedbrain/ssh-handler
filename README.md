# SSH Handler

SSH Handler is a program that handles SSH URIs like [ssh://user@example.com]
(ssh://user@example.com) on Windows. When you click an SSH link in your browser,
it will launch [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) with
he correct SSH parameters.

## Installer

The installer will install SSH Handler and the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile
if it is needed:

* [ssh-handler-1.0.0.exe]
(http://code.douglasthrift.net/files/ssh-handler/ssh-handler-1.0.0.exe) `867 kB`

[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) must be installed
from its installer or available in directory in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Building

The requirements for building SSH Handler and its installer are:

* [Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop]
(http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-desktop)
* [NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)
* [Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (Web Installer)]
